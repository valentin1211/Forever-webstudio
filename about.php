          Valentin and Theo met back in highschool where they started their first entrepreunarial project.
           Through their friendship and projects they both discovered their own passion for web developement.
            Valentin always has been the scientific one spending his time in the chemistry lab... while you would find Theo at museums.

          We're almost always disagreeing on everything which makes us challenge each other to bring the best out of work.
          We treat every project like it was ours.
